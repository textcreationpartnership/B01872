            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed not onely to command the imployment of my Service in Your Highneſſe <hi>Mines-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> occaſioned by ſome diſcourſe of them at <hi>Enſton-Rock,</hi> Your Majeſtie vouchſafing to honour that place with your preſence, but alſo to give your Majeſtie a true rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what they were when I entred upon them, what they are ſince at preſent, and of what hope for the future, if diligently purſued and cheriſht by your Royall aſpect: In obedience whereunto, I do in all humility affirme, That the <hi>Mines</hi> at my firſt entrance were drowned with water, and conſequently not worth the working, <hi>as by ſeverall certificates hereunto annexed appeareth,</hi> which did then much diſencourage my undertakings; but conſidering how deeply your Majeſties many favours had engaged me, the meaneſt of your Subjects, I conceived my ſelfe obliged to adventure upon the undermining of the adjacent Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains, thereby to make triall, whether thoſe <hi>Mines</hi> (if once diſcovered at the ſurface of the earth) would not prove richer in their deeper ſearch; of which, having received ſeverall opinions from the beſt Mineral-maſters of our age, as Sir <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> M. <hi>Alexander Roberts,</hi> M. <hi>Ioſeph Hexſteter,</hi> and M. <hi>Walter Barksby,</hi> with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers well practiſed in that way, encouraging me therein; I then reſolved to hazzard my fortune on them, aſſuring my ſelfe that all <hi>Mines</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> were to be diſcovered by ſome one or other, becauſe originally created for mans uſe, and Gods glory: and thus having ſetled my former ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute
<pb facs="tcp:174090:3"/> thoughts, I began with a cheerefull heart to cut thorow five ſeverall mountains, at their loweſt levell, which by the Art of Dialling appeared to be ſome ſixtie, ſome eightie, and ſome an hundred fathoms perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ſo continued theſe battery-works foure yeers, night and day, before my hopes could give me any happy aſſurance that the <hi>Minerall-beds</hi> of theſe ſubterraneall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lay faſt locked in thoſe barren Rocks, untill my charge grew ſo great, that I became pitied of my friends, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over by my enemies, which did anew perplex my minde: yet when I conſidered that I was not born for my ſelfe, but for the Service of God, your Majeſtie, and my Countrey, and that I had not only that heavenly guider to direct me, but alſo your ſacred Majeſtie to encourage me, I then began to caſt off my former juſtly conceived fears, and (notwithſtanding any oppoſition or ſeeming diſſwaſive arguments) to pitch on this reſolution, that <hi>better it were for me to ſuffer ſhipwrack in my poore eſtate and credit, then that ſuch treaſures ſhould lye buried in the BOWELS of thoſe vaſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and not be made both known, and beneficiall to your gracious Majeſtie, being inherent to your prerogative, as by the Declaration under the hands of learned Counſell hereunto annexed appears, which hills, although large in extent, yet are not conſiderable in herbage, nor fit for any other plough, then the Miners ſledge, gad, and twybill.</p>
            <p>That which firſt wrought in me a deſire to try and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome thoſe <hi>Mines</hi> was a ſenſible diſcourſe delivered me by a <hi>Portugal,</hi> in preſence of Sir <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> (by whoſe death I loſt the hope of a moſt knowing Partner) who had for many yeers been imployed under the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his <hi>Weſt India Mines,</hi> purporting that if his Maſter were Soveraign Lord of thoſe Brittiſh hills, as is your Majeſtie, he ſhould not doubt but to make them a ſecond <hi>Indies,</hi> deeply proteſting that the greateſt riches in thoſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb facs="tcp:174090:3"/> lay in their loweſt levels, which I finde to be true by undeniable experience in thoſe five mountaines. For by this way of driving thorow the depth of Rocks, we are not onely freed from the danger and deluge of waters, but have alſo diſcovered the veines to prove richer in quantity and quality, ſome containing twenty pound, ſome fifteene, ſome tenne, and ſome ſix in Silver, in the Tunne of Lead upon the great <hi>Peſt,</hi> which are anſwerable to moſt of the <hi>Mines</hi> of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> finding moreover, that by mixing and ſmelting theſe ſeverall veines together, the one proves a good additament to the other, and becomes thereby a meanes to advance the Mines-Royall, and in them the good of your Kingdome and Subjects.</p>
            <p>We have many gracious teſtimonies how much the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is pleaſed with theſe our innocent labours, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall preſervation of the workmen amidſt their hourely dangers, eſpecially in one accident, which lately befell, by driving an Addit into one of thoſe mountaines called <hi>Talli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bont;</hi> but b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as I am bound to give to <hi>Cæſar</hi> that which is <hi>Cæſars,</hi> ſo muſt I further humbly acknowledge your Majeſties large addition to your former Royall favours in granting mee (the meaneſt of your Creatures) liberty to give your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties impreſſion to ſuch Silver as the Mole-like Miners caſt out of the Earth, for their ſpeedier payment, they being the men who make the Rocks their reſting place, and expect no other reward or benefit for their ſweaty browes then what they gaine from out of the darke Cavernes of the earth by importunate labour.</p>
            <p>And for declaration of part of my poore indeavours,
<pb facs="tcp:174090:4"/> your humbleſt ſuppliant begs a peruſall of the annexed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, preſented by your honourable and grave mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Juſtice, and other noble Gentlemen of quality, reſiding within your Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> whoſe eyes have been ſpectators, as your ſervant, a diligent labourer in thoſe <hi>Minerall Vineyards.</hi> And having thus far traced out, &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

So that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing more to make the inſide of theſe barren Mountaines produce an addition of gems to your Crown, but to finiſh the building of your princely foundation by your Royall recommendation thereof to your High Court of Parliament, whoſe judgements will quickly diſcerne how much theſe <hi>Mines</hi> would redound to the generall good; your Majeſties gracious Letters ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already cauſed ſundry Merchants, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of quality to take a perſonall view of the gaine, which accrewes from this publike worke of the <hi>Mines Royall,</hi> as a means to inrich Your Subjects the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> of thoſe parts, with the free trade and vent of their <hi>Home made cloth,</hi> and to enable them to become Merchant-adventurers, as well by land as ſea.

<pb facs="tcp:174090:4"/> hazzard a portion of their preſent fortunes as a lot, ſo as they may be ſecured to enjoy thoſe prizes which divine providence ſhall caſt and conferre upon them in theſe their ſo honeſt adventures. And for manifeſt proofe of my proceedings in this buſineſſe, I ſhall, with Your Royall aſſent, humbly deſire a Commiſſion from the High Court of Parliament, to examine the former and preſent ſtate of the <hi>Mines Royall,</hi> and your Majeſties riches that are buried under the moſt inconſiderable herbage of theſe vaſt Mountains, which in time may alter the name of <hi>Welch Rocks</hi> into <hi>Welch Indies,</hi> and make it plainly appeare to any, (who is not meerly of an earthly and avaricious temper, and can in any meaſure reſent the true ſupport of a flouriſhing State) that they (if followed) cannot but prove flowers to the Crowne, a glory to the Kingdom, and a rich bleſſing to the Subject.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed therefore, moſt gracious Soveraign, to vouchſafe that the beames of your Royall favour may cheriſh the growth of this hopefull deſigne, ſo as it be not blaſted in the bud, and then my affectionate endeavours prove as fruitleſſe to this Common-wealth, as was the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected tender of <hi>Columbus</hi> his diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt-Indian Mines</hi> in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>And to make it in ſome meaſure appeare to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, how deſirous I am to advance your revenew in an imployment ſo much conducing to the publike good, I do, in all humbleneſſe offer (as an increaſe of rent after the expiration of the Lady <hi>Middletons</hi> leaſe aſſigned to me, and yet in being) one thouſand pounds by the yeer for and during the continuance of another leaſe thereof grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me in reverſion; for confirmation of which leaſes by your Majeſtie, and your High Court of Parliament, I do further humbly preſent 1000 Marks as a prefine to your Majeſties Privie Purſe, over and above the benefit of your

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT whereas your Royall Father, of ever bleſſed memory, who was truly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the King of Peace, and mirror of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the ſparing of life and blood, was graciouſly pleaſed, for ſaving the lives of ſuch malefactors as were condemned to death by the Law for Petty fellonies, being ſuch as were not any ſcandall to the Church or State, nor had imbrewed their hands in blood, to admit their tranſportation to the Eaſt India, and Virginia-Companies, for furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their plantations. In which action doubtleſſe he did alſo caſt his eyes upon the warrantable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and preſidents of other moſt famous Princes in the like kinde, as the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who put certain Gallies of purpoſe for imployment of ſuch kind of offenders, of ſtrong and able bodies, as might attend her memorable deſignes at Sea, eſpecially upon all ſuddain and reſolute enterprizes; it being the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all courſe of other Chriſtian Princes, as the King of Spain, both for the ſupply of his Gallies againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:174090:6"/> Turks and Moores, and eſpecially for the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Indian Mines of Gold, Silver, Quickſilver, and the like, and his conqueſts of <hi>Mollocco, Goa, Ormus,</hi> and other rich &amp; populous Ilands. The King of <hi>France</hi> for his Gallyes at <hi>Marſellis.</hi> The State of <hi>Venice.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> who by ſuch kind of ſaved offendors built <hi>Ligorne</hi> (one of the moſt famous Sea-ports with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Straits) In all which States and Services, divers of theſe malefactors by good incouragements have ſought, not ſo much by ſurviving, as by their incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble labours, effecting matters, otherwiſe held invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to obliterate their former ignominies by merit of rewards. And whereas in this your Majeſties populous Kingdome, too many ſuch offendors are moſt untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off in their beſt abilities of ſervice, ſo is there within the pale of this Your Kingdome, and without any occaſion of Sea, or forreigne ſervice, means of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for ſuch perſons, to redeeme their loſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by endeavouring to doe faithfull ſervice for their Countries honour, and the Kingdomes good, in that happy worke, begun by your Sacred Majeſtie, for the better diſcovery of Your Silver Mines. His moſt humble ſuit therefore is, that You would be pleaſed, out of all theſe weighty conſiderations and beneficiall conſequences, tending ſo much to your Honor, Crown and Dignity, and good of the Common-wealth, to grant your Majeſties Commiſſion, (if it may be thought fit by the advice of your High and Honourable Court of Parliament) for the chooſing of ſuch ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of the priſons in this your Kingdome, as are and ſhall be condemned for ſmall offences, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſerviceable bodies, by the approbation of Your
<pb facs="tcp:174090:7"/> Judges, and ſhall implore your Majeſties mercy to be imployed by your ſaid ſubject in the workes of your Mines-Royall, they giving ſecurity for their good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, with ſuch limitation of time, and allowance for their ſuſtentation, as to your Majeſties ſaid High Court of Parliament ſhall be thought fit, that by their dutifull and laborious performance therein, they may afterwards come into the happineſſe of your Majeſties pardon of grace for their former offences;</p>

            <p>ACCORDING to your commands, We whoſe names are under written, being <hi>Miners, Smelters, Refiners, Carryers, Waſhers,</hi> and <hi>Monyers</hi> belonging to his Majeſties <hi>Mines-Royall,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> in all humility do certifie of our certain knowledge and experience, concerning the new works lately diſcovered by Gods providence to <hi>Thomas Buſhell</hi> Eſquire, Farmer of his Majeſties <hi>Mines-Royall</hi> in theſe parts, That the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Buſhell</hi> at his ineſtimable charge, having cut ſix hundred Fathom thorow the Rock at the loweſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, North and South, for diſcovering the loſt veine of <hi>Cum-ſum</hi> lock, lying Eaſt and Weſt, two hundred Fathom thorow the Mountain of <hi>Tallibont,</hi> at ſixty Fathom perpendicular, three ſeverall <hi>Addits</hi> at <hi>Kogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,</hi> one above another, twenty, and thirty Fathom center, another at the <hi>Darren,</hi> to come under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> work, at an hundred Fathom center, another at <hi>Bryn LLoyd</hi> fifty Fathom in length, and thirty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom center, working day and night for the Drayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:174090:10"/> of the water, which formerly in the time of Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Smith,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> in their working of the <hi>Mines-Royall</hi> was never uſed, they onely working upon the Superficies of the Earth, the works being drowned with water before they could ſink to the beſt of the vein, both for quantity and quality, and ſo the charge made to exceed the benefit, which danger is prevented by the aforeſaid <hi>Addits,</hi> and the <hi>Royall Mines</hi> become more hopefull, eſpecially by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Majeſties Mint, for the ſpeedy payment of all thoſe that are imployed in the ſaid works, and Mr. <hi>Buſhells</hi> own invention to ſave Wood, by reducing the Ore into Lead, and Silver, with Turffe and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole Charked, which happy invention had it not been found out, the works muſt needs have been left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought, the Countrey not able to have ſupplyed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Fewell. And further, by the prohibition of tranſporting Ore unwrought, that holdeth ſilver worth the refining, which His <hi>Majeſtie</hi> in his Princely wiſdom ſaw to be very prejudiciall, even to the utter overthrow of his <hi>Mines-Royall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have therefore great reaſon to be confident that his way of working, with the reſtraint of tranſporting Ore, will in ſhort time greatly increaſe the Bullion of this Kingdom, for the honour of the King, and good of the Common-wealth, together with the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many hundred poore people, which would be otherwiſe an unſupportable burthen to this barren Countrey, who by their preſent labour in theſe <hi>Mines</hi> are able to ſubſiſt with their Family, and thouſands more might be daily ſet on work, if Mr, <hi>Buſhells</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
<pb facs="tcp:174090:11"/> in the <hi>Mines-Royall</hi> may be confirmed for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time by this preſent High Court of Parliament</p>

<pb facs="tcp:174090:12"/> times; for by melting the poore fuſible Ore with the rich, he produceth a third part more of ſilver with the ſame charge: and for accommodating the workes with all materials fit for <hi>Mines Royall,</hi> hee hath ſpared no coſt about repairing the Milles, hath alſo built in his Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Aberyſtwith</hi> a faire Mint, hath contracted with Merchants of our owne and other Nations to ſupply the peoples neceſſity with Corne and other proviſions, and payeth the Miners and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the Scales, and doubteth not to make them able Pyoners, and fit Souldiers to do his Majeſtie and their Countrey ſervice upon any aſſault of an enemy.

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SUffer my congratulations of your late ſucceſſe at <hi>Tallybont</hi> to be admitted amongſt the reſt who have repreſented the ſame to your imagination; not ſo much for the hiſtoricall report of it, as for ſpeculation on it; So it becomes my quality, for the reſt are intereſſed, I a looker on your <hi>Addit</hi> or great drift of <hi>Tallybont,</hi> after above 200 fathome in foure yeers driving to come at the chief ſhaft of the old drown'd work of 38 fathom deepe, being pierced by the water of the old worke, <hi>Iune</hi> 27, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night there befell two memorable accidents. The foure workmen about one in the night (as their manner was) withdrew to take <hi>Tobacco</hi> within ten fathom of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits</hi> mouth, leſt in the Forefield it ſhould damp the ayre, which was conveyed to them by your Leaden pipes with bellowes: Their ſmoakie banquet was not yet at an end when they heard a mighty and fearefull noiſe, which ſome of them ſaid was thunder: But old <hi>Bartholmew Clocker</hi> (a well experienced <hi>Miner</hi>) although he left the worke without any ſuſpition of ſo neere an approach, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſuddenly, the worke is holed, come let us away. No ſooner had they gotten the free ayre, but out guſheth the torrent of water with an incredible fury, ſuch a breach it made in the ſolid Rock, that it aroſe a full yards height at the <hi>Addits</hi> mouth, and drove away above 100 Tun of the rockie deads, affrighting the people of <hi>Tallybont,</hi> who heard the noiſe, and felt the water in their houſes.
<pb facs="tcp:174090:15"/> I do not remember that I was ever more aſtoniſhed at the prodiglouſneſſe of any ſpectacle, to ſee what perdition was threatned to the poore men, and they ſo to eſcape it. About foure houres after, the violence of water being paſt, <hi>Fiſher,</hi> one other of the <hi>Miners,</hi> went in with more curioſity then wit, to ſee what effect it had wrought there: and being ſome ſixty fathom in, creeping very low, his candle enkindled a vapour, which came on him with three or foure flaſhes, and he ſuddenly returning had his haire burnt off, and his cloathes ſcorched, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion it gave a crack like the report of a peece, and in a fierce guſt of wind blew out the Candles of three more coming after him. To omit the Philoſophicall inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of naturall cauſes, I account his preſervation in as high a degree of wonder as the firſt. Thus happy are you here when leaſt you thinke of it, for I find the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean ſpirits, the ſuppoſed guardians of concealed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as officious for you as if they were in pay with you. But in a ſtile more proper to my pen, Behold Sir, how deare you are to Providence, which for your ſake hath vouchſafed to digreſſe into a miracle, and ſuch an one as is able to convert the moſt Sophiſticall <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> whence your piety will inferre, that the gracious Authour of this incomparable bounty, expects from you ſome gratefull ſervice, as high above ordinary (according to mortall capacity) as this favour hath been extraordinary. We are all deeply in the ſame engagement, and have learned by this experiment, that theſe <hi>Addits</hi> or Approaches (for thats, the ſence of the name of old deluge works) are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of deſperate hazzard. Me thinks theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are as ſo many pregnant wombs, and now in labour call for your fortunate hands to deliver them, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your Royall Maſter, and perpetuated glory of the Nation.</p>

            <p>I know it would be a motive of very feeble operation to tell you how Princes &amp; States have raiſed their Crowns, by deſcending into ſuch Thyſſeſes as theſe; with ſome of whom wanton Antiquity hath been pleaſed to ſport her ſelf, and to play upon the ſimplicity of many, as <hi>Midas, Gyges,</hi> the <hi>Argonauts, Crœſus,</hi> with the States of <hi>Athens,</hi> over whoſe Minerals was that renowned <hi>Thucydides</hi> a <hi>Præfect,</hi> as you are here; of which <hi>Pliny</hi> delivers what may be worthy your attention, when he ſayes of them, that they were in a fruitleſſe ſoyle, and on the hills, (as theſe with us:) and whereſoever one veine was found, it was not far from another; among which was one called <hi>Bebelo,</hi> that afforded him 300 pound weight of Silver a day.</p>
